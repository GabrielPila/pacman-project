To run the script which allows the pacman agent to move according to what the model mandates, please use the following instructions.

__Instructions:__
1. Clone the repository
2. Enter the repository folder: `cd pacman-project`
3. Create a virtual environment: `virtualenv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Install the necessary packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Run `python pacman.py -p my_ML_Agent`
7. The pacman agent should be moving according to the model implemented.
